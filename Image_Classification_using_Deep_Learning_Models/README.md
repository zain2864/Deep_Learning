This deep learning project focuses on exploring and understanding the PyTorch framework through its different levels of abstraction. The project aims to develop and train neural network models for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The project covers the following aspects:

Preparation: Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Barebones PyTorch: Implementing neural networks using low-level PyTorch Tensors with autograd.

PyTorch Module API: Defining neural network architectures using the nn.Module API, including linear layers, convolutional layers, and different network configurations.

PyTorch Sequential API: Building and training neural networks using the more convenient nn.Sequential API.

Open-ended challenge: Experimenting with various ConvNet architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers to achieve at least 70% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 validation set within 10 epochs.
