However, since every item is processed in parallel, there is no notion of ordering of the sequence. For an input sentence, this means that the transformer doesn't know the ordering of the words in the sentence. For most tasks, this ordering is very important. To address this, transformers propose adding a positional encoding to each input that corresponds to the position in the sequence. This means that we take the position of each word in the sentence (eg. 0, 1, 2, etc...) and map it to some $d_{model}$-dimensional embedding. We then add this embedding with every input item so that the input is not position-aware. Transformers use the following sinusoidal positional encoding:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align*}\n","PE_{(pos, 2i)} &= sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}}) \\\\\n","PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} &= cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}}) \n","\\end{align*}\n","$$\n","\n","An example borrowed from this [blog](https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/) can give an ituition how this positional encoding works.
